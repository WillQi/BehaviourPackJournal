# Behaviour Pack Journal

## Introduction - July 6 2020

The first entry is usually the most difficult one to write in my opinion. It's July 6th, 2020, and something I want to accomplish this summer, is to learn as much as I can about Minecraft Behaviour Packs. Minecraft is a video game (duh) that I'm passionate about and have countless hours in-game. The ability to create behaviour packs to add in new content or change existing gameplay is exciting! While it's not really considered a programming project in my opinion, I felt that it would be nice to document my journey as I learn more about it and what it can do. 
So sit back, relax, and I guess have fun reading my journal?
